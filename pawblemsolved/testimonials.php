						<h2>Roscoe</h2>
						<p>
							We love Pawblem Solved!  Danielle is so easy to work with.  We like working with people who communicate well, 
							are organized, and deliver on their promises.  Danielle offers all of these qualities, and our dog absolutely 
							adores Danielle!  Our doggy is still a puppy, so she has been nice enough to leave us daily notes on her 
							outtings with Roscoe. It's nice to know what his day was like.   
						</p>
						<p>
							She has also taken extra care of Roscoe 
							when he has gotten unexpectedly sick during the day and sends us text messages if there is anything out of 
							the ordinary.  We really appreciate and love the services we receive from Pawblem Solved.  We give our golden 
							stamp of approval and highly recommend them!!

						<h2>Walks with Audrey</h2>
						<p>
						Danielle has worked for me several times as a back-up for my Issaquah Highlands dog walking service. She has always been extremely flexible, dependable and absolutely wonderful with all of my clients' pets. I feel very confident that she takes perfect care of them whenever I cannot visit them myself.
						</p>
						<p>
						"Pawblem Solved" certainly solved my problem and gave me the chance to go on vacation or take a day off now and then without having to let my clients down. Thank you, Danielle, for being such a reliable and cheerful back-up!

						<h2>Princess, Baywood and Minnesota</h2>

							I cannot believe Princess came out for you! Princess let you play with her when she has hidden from others she has had exposure to for years.
						</p>

							You are worth every penny!
