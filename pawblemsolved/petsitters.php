                            Animals are my passion; I have a bucket list full of animal-related activities, events & goals. <br/>
                            I grew up with dogs; Golden Retrievers, Old English Sheepdogs, Shibas, Shih Tzus, mixed breeds... <br/>
                            I love dogs of all temperaments, shapes and sizes! <br/>
                            We raised Casper, an Umbrella Cockatoo, who had the voice of an opera singer! <br/>
                            When I was 14, I began cleaning horse stalls in exchange for riding lessons.<br/>
                            I joined 4-H when I turned 15 and became highly involved with that.<br/>
                            To help put myself through college, I got a job at a veterinary hospital.<br/>
                            10 years ago, I adopted a ragdoll rescue kitty that I named Gracie, who quickly became my best friend.<br/>
                            Since losing Gracie, I adopted two more little furballs; Kona & Riley, who make me smile every day.<br/>
                            I am currently training with my 14 month old daughter, for a charity run for Old Dog Haven. <br/>
                            My husband and I have volunteered with the Seattle Pug Rescue for many years. <br/>
                            We also donate a portion of our income each year to animal shelters & sponsoring final refuge pets. <br/>
                            I am a member of the <a href="http://www.petsitters.org/">National Association of Professional Pet Sitters (NAPPS)</a>.<br/>
                            I actively <a href="http://www.gracieslittleworld.com">blog</a> about current pet events, pet care, and various other animal-related topics.<br/>

							    Kris’s true love for animals began as a young child, when his parents brought him home a little 
                                Lhasa Apso he named Jester. Jester moved to Kirkland from Alaska with him in April, 2000, 
                                where they kept each other company during the transition to a new city.

							    He currently volunteers with Danielle at events for the Seattle Pug Rescue, and is a 
                                part-time pet sitter and dog walker for Pawblem Solved. Though he is a full-time computer 
                                programmer, he truly enjoys his time working with the pets. Jester sadly passed away a 
                                few years ago, so it gives him the opportunity to still have animals in his life.

						        I am and always will be drawn to animals, I couldn't imagine
						        growing up, or living life without my furry family additions. My
						        family consists of two dogs; Durango and Suzie, and three cats;
						        Jake, Trixie and Zilla. My animals are my children and they are
						        all spoiled rotten but deservingly so. I owe them so much as they
						        recently help me get through a most difficult and painful time in my
						        life.
						    </p>
						    <p>
						        I have always worked in a corporate environment, behind the
						        computer, which paid the bills but was never personally satisfying.
						        Now I look forward to each day caring for the needs of a furry
						        acquaintance. I have learned a lot from being around animals but
						        what our pets teach us the most is to see with our heart and to love
						        without condition.

							    I have been around animals my whole life. I grew up on a farm in Connecticut,

							    I will always remember at the age of 5 yrs. old, that special day when my mother brought home our Beagle/Basset hound puppy. My love for animals began then.
						    </p>
						    <p>
							    My husband and I have a household filled with four cats (Mia, Aussie, Rocco, Keiko) and two dogs  (Diesel and Rudy), that we love dearly and treat as children. Last year, we adopted Rudy, a senior (11 yrs. old) from Old Dog Haven. We have learned so much about caring for a senior dog. All of our furry “kids” are a bit quirky like Mia my long-haired cat who will steal your shoes in the middle of the night. Lol.

						    I have always loved animals, starting from when I was little and had my collection of stuffed animals in my room, to the dogs that my family had when I was growing up (a beagle first, than an Airedale poodle), to my first animal-related volunteer work at a local animal shelter caring for dogs and cats.  When I moved to San Diego from New Jersey to start my college career I got more involved with wildlife conservation first via donations, petition signings, and letters with various organizations involved with wildlife issues around the world.  Then I found out about an exotic feline and breeding facility that was open to the public for tours, in which people could see some of the cats the organization saved from private owners and smaller roadside facilities.  They also breed certain species for zoos.  There I led tours and helped with the feeding of the cats and cleaning of their enclosures.  After some time volunteering there I got involved with a wolf sanctuary and education facility caring for the wolves and maintaining their enclosures.  This facility was also open to the public for daily tours and special events. It was great fun talking to the people about wolves in general and conservation issues that were going on at the time, while observing the wolves interact with each other close-up.  I volunteered there for about 6 years.  When I moved up here to Seattle I found out about a similar facility in Tenino, Wolf Haven International, and have enjoyed the volunteer work that I have been doing there.
 						</p>
 						<p>
							Just recently I adopted a Husky/White German Shepard, Yukaiaha is her name, and she is absolutely wonderful.  Great outdoor activity companion, especially in the snow, and so much personality - I have learned quite a bit from her.  Even though I don't have a wildlife biology or any animal related career background I have always had a love of animals and get so much enjoyment and satisfaction of being able to interact and help any way I can with wild and domestic animals.

						    I grew up on a 160 acre farm with animals of all shapes and sizes to play with and love.  I learned early that all animals have their own personality and bring joy in different ways.  
							I also learned to pay attention to their moods to notice if they were happy and healthy.   I was a 4-H’er for 13 years.  I started showing the barnyard animals.  After a move and downsize, 
							I headed to the 4-H dog program.  I started with my family’s already obedience trained Sheltie, Taffy.  Then, I raised two puppies for Guide Dogs for the Blind, a Golden Retriever, Mabel, 
							and a German Shepherd, Alexis.  At 16, I got MY obedience dog, Liesje, a Keeshond.  I was having so much fun with obedience classes and dog shows, my mom got a Miniature Poodle, Toby, 
							and joined me.  Liesje and I earned our obedience CD (Companion Dog) title before I went off to college.  After college, Emily, a Staffordshire Terrier found her way into my life.  
							Since 2009, my husband and I have two short haired gray cats, Eris and Thalia, who like having only a dog statue in the house. Loving cats has been an enjoyable adjustment for this 
							dog person.  I am looking forward to spending time with your pet, when you need to be away.

							My first “own” dog was Frango Mint (I love those candies ) a Black Labrador. She
							was very loving and sweet and was so gentle with my newborn fraternal twins. My next
							dog was Rocco Gucci, a Norwegian Elkhound (I’m half Norwegian). He was quite the
							character. He loved to go on “sniff walks” and speedy snowshoeing hikes. Then Riley
							became an addition to our family, an 18 pound Ragdoll. We had him on our sailboat
							where his favorite thing was to boat hop going from one boat to the next greeting
							everyone when we were in port.

							Our current pup is Nicki para Nicaragua. We spent four years sailing the Pacific coast
							and found her in Nicaragua. She’s a small mixed dog and loves her Frisbee. She’s our
							baby.

							I’m so happy to meet and take care of your beautiful cats and dogs!

							I have always had a passion for animals! I have two dogs, named Max and Marley and a spoiled rotten cat named Calvin. 
							I consider them my kids, they are my world! Since I can remember I have been taking care of animals. Throughout my life, 
							I have had dogs, a cat, bird, snake, lizard, and a hamster! I have professionally worked with dogs and cats for about 4 
							years now and will never stop. My long term goal is to open a doggie daycare and pet resort! I also aspire to start a 
							dog rescue in the future! Animals are my everything and they deserve as much love and tenderness as us humans do!

							Since I can remember I have had a passion for animals. I've had many different and eccentric 
							friends so far; from a cat that would sleep in his pajamas, and a dog that was crazy about 
							sweet pizza, to a chinchilla that thought it was a cat.

							Being originally from Brazil, I moved to Redmond in 2007, and back again in 2013. During my 
							time in Brazil, I cared for, and brought back to health, a variety of homeless animals. 
							After spending three years in Germany, I adopted my two beautiful cats, Flor-de-Lis and Amélie.
