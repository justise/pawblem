							7 years ago, I adopted a ragdoll rescue kitty that I named Gracie. She's a doll.<br/>
							My family has always owned dogs; Golden Retrievers, Old English Sheepdogs, Shibas.<br/>
							We also raised Casper, an Umbrella Cockatoo. He had the voice of an opera singer! <br/>
							When I was 14, I began cleaning horse stalls in exchange for riding lessons.<br/>
							I joined 4-H when I was 15 and became highly involved with that.<br/>
							To help put myself through college, I got a job at a veterinary hospital.<br/>
							I am a member of the National Association of Professional Pet Sitters (NAPPS).<br/>
							I also actively blog about current pet events, pet care, and various other pet topics.<br/>

							<h2>Kris Gray</h2>
							<h4>Head of IT &amp; Part-Time Pet Nanny/Dog Walker</h4>
						</div>
						<p>
							Kris’s true love for animals began as a young child, when his parents brought him home a little Lhasa Apso he named Jester. Jester moved to Seattle from Alaska with him in April, 2000, where they kept each other company and grounded during the transition to a new city.
						</p>
						<p>
							He currently volunteers with Danielle at events for the Seattle Pug Rescue, and is a part-time pet sitter and dog walker for Pawblem Solved. Though he is a full-time computer programmer, he truly enjoys his time working with the pets. Jester sadly passed away a few years ago, so it gives him the opportunity to still have animals in his life. “There is nothing more rewarding than happy, healthy pets!”

						    I am and always will be drawn to animals, I couldn't imagine
						    growing up, or living life without my furry family additions. My
						    family consists of two dogs; Durango and Suzie, and three cats;
						    Jake, Trixie and Zilla. My animals are my children and they are
						    all spoiled rotten but deservingly so. I owe them so much as they
						    recently help me get through a most difficult and painful time in my
						    life.
						</p>
						<p>
						    I have always worked in a corporate environment, behind the
						    computer, which paid the bills but was never personally satisfying.
						    Now I look forward to each day caring for the needs of a furry
						    acquaintance. I have learned a lot from being around animals but
						    what our pets teach us the most is to see with our heart and to love
						    without condition.

							I have been around animals my whole life. I grew up on a farm in Connecticut, 
							and remember spending time with a calf because she was lonely when I was not near her.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since moving to Seattle eight years ago, I have enjoyed keeping 
							pets company while their owners are out of town.  I love being 
							with them, and getting to understand their personalities.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now that I am in Grad School, walking and loving my four legged 
							friends has been a great joy.

							Hi, I'm Amanda, I'm from Kirkland and I've had pets all my life: a Beagle, 
							a Dalmatian, a mixed breed dog, and a calico cat.
						</p>
						<p>
							Last year I adopted my pug, Diego, and he has been my trusty little companion ever since.  
							I take him to Seattle Pug Rescue events and Pug MeetUp groups and even hosted a dog birthday 
							party for him. I think that animals truly can be your best friends, and provide all sorts of 
							benefits for your health (lower blood pressure, longer life, lower stress levels, etc.)  
							I am a UW Alum and also work for a local software company.  
						</p>
						<p>
							I'm happy to be a part of the team and I think it's fun to meet all the happy dogs and 
							cats and their loving owners.

						    I have always loved animals, starting from when I was little and had my collection of stuffed animals in my room, to the dogs that my family had when I was growing up (a beagle first, than an Airedale poodle), to my first animal-related volunteer work at a local animal shelter caring for dogs and cats.  When I moved to San Diego from New Jersey to start my college career I got more involved with wildlife conservation first via donations, petition signings, and letters with various organizations involved with wildlife issues around the world.  Then I found out about an exotic feline and breeding facility that was open to the public for tours, in which people could see some of the cats the organization saved from private owners and smaller roadside facilities.  They also breed certain species for zoos.  There I led tours and helped with the feeding of the cats and cleaning of their enclosures.  After some time volunteering there I got involved with a wolf sanctuary and education facility caring for the wolves and maintaining their enclosures.  This facility was also open to the public for daily tours and special events. It was great fun talking to the people about wolves in general and conservation issues that were going on at the time, while observing the wolves interact with each other close-up.  I volunteered there for about 6 years.  When I moved up here to Seattle I found out about a similar facility in Tenino, Wolf Haven International, and have enjoyed the volunteer work that I have been doing there.

							Just recently I adopted a Husky/White German Shepard, Yukaiaha is her name, and she is absolutely wonderful.  Great outdoor activity companion, especially in the snow, and so much personality - I have learned quite a bit from her.  Even though I don't have a wildlife biology or any animal related career background I have always had a love of animals and get so much enjoyment and satisfaction of being able to interact and help any way I can with wild and domestic animals.

						    I grew up on a 160 acre farm with animals of all shapes and sizes to play with and love.  I learned early that all animals have their own personality and bring joy in different ways.  
							I also learned to pay attention to their moods to notice if they were happy and healthy.   I was a 4-H’er for 13 years.  I started showing the barnyard animals.  After a move and downsize, 
							I headed to the 4-H dog program.  I started with my family’s already obedience trained Sheltie, Taffy.  Then, I raised two puppies for Guide Dogs for the Blind, a Golden Retriever, Mabel, 
							and a German Shepherd, Alexis.  At 16, I got MY obedience dog, Liesje, a Keeshond.  I was having so much fun with obedience classes and dog shows, my mom got a Miniature Poodle, Toby, 
							and joined me.  Liesje and I earned our obedience CD (Companion Dog) title before I went off to college.  After college, Emily, a Staffordshire Terrier found her way into my life.  
							Since 2009, my husband and I have two short haired gray cats, Eris and Thalia, who like having only a dog statue in the house. Loving cats has been an enjoyable adjustment for this 
							dog person.  I am looking forward to spending time with your pet, when you need to be away.

						    My name is Diane and I am a Pawblem Solver!

							My family had two animals when I was growing up…Suzzie Wong, the Chinese Pug
							and Smokie, the Siamese Cat. They both had wonderfully unique personalities that
							entertained my family constantly.
						</p>
						<p>
							My first “own” dog was Frango Mint (I love those candies ) a Black Labrador. She
							was very loving and sweet and was so gentle with my newborn fraternal twins. My next
							dog was Rocco Gucci, a Norwegian Elkhound (I’m half Norwegian). He was quite the
							character. He loved to go on “sniff walks” and speedy snowshoeing hikes. Then Riley
							became an addition to our family, an 18 pound Ragdoll. We had him on our sailboat
							where his favorite thing was to boat hop going from one boat to the next greeting
							everyone when we were in port.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our current pup is Nicki para Nicaragua. We spent four years sailing the Pacific coast
							and found her in Nicaragua. She’s a small mixed dog and loves her Frisbee. She’s our
							baby.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’m so happy to meet and take care of your beautiful cats and dogs!

							I have always had a passion for animals! I have two dogs, named Max and Marley and a spoiled rotten cat named Calvin. 
							I consider them my kids, they are my world! Since I can remember I have been taking care of animals. Throughout my life,

							Since I can remember I have had a passion for animals. I've had many different and eccentric

							Being originally from Brazil, I moved to Redmond in 2007, and back again in 2013. During my

							After spending three years in Germany, I adopted my two beautiful cats, Flor-de-Lis and Amélie.
