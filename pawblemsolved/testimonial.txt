I just moved from New York City to Bellevue, WA four months ago. I have two dogs: a bichon-frise and a mixed cocker-bichon. We used to have a dog walker back in Manhattan for the last 5 years.  At first, I was nervous, moving to a new place, since this would be a big change for me and my dogs. Especially, since they had been with the same dog walker for 5 years.  
 
Danielle's positive attitude toward the well-being of animals became noticeable once she walked into my door. She made sure that we had nothing to worry about. She was very professional, patient and thorough explaining everything with me.  
 
During a rainy day (it rains a lot in Seattle), or a very hot day, she still walks my dogs (a shorter time), and then she spends the rest of the time playing with them in the house so that they have enough exercise that day.  
 
Recently, one of my dogs had a paw injury. He had to walk slowly and needed a pouch to keep the bandage dry. Danielle spent extra time to make sure the pouch was securely placed. After the walk, she checked if the paw was ok. 
 
She genuinely loves dogs. She notices if something is wrong with your dogs, and always makes sure the food and water are full before she leaves the house. 
 
I have a crazy work schedule, and Danielle is always available even last minute.  She has been great! I am so lucky to know her and have her take care of my dogs. I would highly recommend Danielle to anyone looking for a reliable and caring person to look after their pets
