                                We are always searching for new team members, who love animals and the great outdoors!

                                <ul>
                                    <li>You're retired and searching for something fun to do with your time, that will get you exercise and fresh air.</li>

                            </p>

                                Please keep in mind that we never overload our schedules, so it's important that the individual understands this is a part-time position.
